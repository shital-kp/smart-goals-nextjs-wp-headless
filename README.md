**## How to get started and how To Reproduce The Issue**

  1. Clone this repository in your local environment.
  2. After cloning, open up a terminal in the same location and run -> **npm i or npm install**

  7. This endpoint needs to be pasted in the .env file in NextJS (ignore if already done).
  8. In the same terminal where we ran npm i, after everything's installed, run **npm run dev**
  9. Open the app, i.e **localhost:3000** and you should see the page load like this

    Correctly render the featured images for each post

**##2 Expected Behavior**

âœ… Running the app should:

  Correctly load posts list on Homepage.

  The images on the posts do not load.

**##5 Hints**
